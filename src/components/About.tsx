                My name’s Lari, and I am a creative artist and software developer based in Aotearoa New Zealand.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy building memorable, fun and meaningful projects, and have a strong focus on making all things
                simple, as they should be.
            </p>
            <p>
                My day-to day sees a wide range of technology, however my main tools of trade are Typescript, React,
                Tailwind, Node and MongoDB.
            </p>
            <p>
                When not programming, you may find me listening to 80’s rock, making a good family Raclette and taking
                anyone I can convince to go on a 5 hour walk. Probably longer.
